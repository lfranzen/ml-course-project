* Set up git repo
* Got access to potential data resource with breast cancer ST data, however the pathologist annotations are missing. Publication: https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13058-019-1242-9  
* Got access to another ST breast cancer data repo related to another project where more samples are available and all neccessary files were present. Publication: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.200600v1.full.pdf  
* Downloaded all data files from https://github.com/almaan/her2st

* Plan for project and its scope
* Look for suitable ST data. Requirements: Count matrices, H&E images, spot files, and properly annotated spots/images needs to be available.  
* ST tumour data: first step is to predict which spots are cancer / non-cancer using only expression data. Second step, see if it is also possible to differentiate between different cancers.
